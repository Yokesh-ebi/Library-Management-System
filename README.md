# This SQL Server script includes two stored procedures: CheckOutBook and ReturnBook. The CheckOutBook procedure handles book checkout operations, updating the books and borrowers tables accordingly, and calculates a due date. The ReturnBook procedure manages book returns, calculates late fees if applicable, and updates the transactions, books, and borrowers tables. Both procedures ensure transactional integrity with error handling.
